# RE-Vogue - A Django and React App

A Django, PostgresSQL, React full-stack app. My final project for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive.

### Developed by:

- Ornella Spada

## Deployment 

- I deployed this website using Heroku and it is available [here](https://re-vogue.netlify.app/). The free servers on Heroku sleep when they are not it use, so please allow a minute or two for them to wake up! 

## Concept 

**Re-VOGUE** has some similarities with the renowned fashion magazine website to which the aestetics of the platform is entirely inpired with its 90s minimalistic flare. This app is triggered by my passion about 90's fashion and the concept of circular economy and sustainability. Apart from reading on 90s fashion icons such as Carolyne Bessette, users can also BUY, RENT and ADD to WISHLIST their favourite garments that are taken from old collections inventories. This website is an avant-gard version of future high-end e-commerce websites and its aim is to make the second most polluting industry on Earth have a positive impact on the bioshere and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. 

## Project Brief
- One week to plan, build, and test our final project with a focus on cementing the learning from the past 11 weeks and showing off our new Python skills.
- Choose to work solo, as a pair, or as a group for the duration of the project.
- Review project proposal with our instructor so we can make sure it can be accomplished in the limited time we have.
- Build a full-stack application by making our own backend and front-end.
- Use a Python Django API, using Django REST Framework to serve our data from a PostgresSQL database.
- Consume our API with a separate frontend built with React.
- Build a complete product, which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models.
- Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes that are significant enough to help us know which features are core MVP and which can be cut.
- Have a visually impressive design and be deployed online so it's publicly accessible.
- A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted project and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project.

## MVP

I kept out MVP fairly simple with the option to add future features later on.
My main requirements were:

- E-commerce platform for renting, selling or simply adding to wishlist high-end fashion clothes from old inventories.
- User authentication - Register & Login.
- A home page with articles on 90s style and icons.
- An Index Page for all runways including a search function based on Season, Year and Brand.
- A single garment view, with the option to buy, sell or add to the wishlist. 
- A review function, with the ability to delete the comment if the user has created the comment.
- A rent function where user can choose the date of the return.
- A personal profile where user can see her history activity on the digital real estate.
- An aestetically stunning UI experience which is inspired by 90's minimalistic style and the pristine
